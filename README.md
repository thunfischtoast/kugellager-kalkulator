# kugellager-kalkulator
A calculator to mix up the icebreaker method "Bearing" (in German: "Kugellager")

# Description
In the icebreaker game ["Bearing"](http://www.games-wiki.org/wiki/Bearing/) the players stand in two circles, one inner and one outer, with 2 persons (each 1 from both circles) facing each other.
The 2 persons do some kind of task (usually talking about a specific topic) and after some time the trainer will tell one of the circles to move 1 step, so now each person faces a new partner.
With this new revolutionary tool you enable the trainer to shake it up a bit: instead of moving up 1 person in the same direction every round you can skip multiple persons and change the direction once in while. 
You are still guranteed to face each partner from the other circle only once.

# Usage
Go to https://thunfischtoast.github.io/kugellager-kalkulator/open_this , enter the number of players and click "Neu".
The program will output instructions for each round, telling you which circle should rotate in which direction and how many steps.
